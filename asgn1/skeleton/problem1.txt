# Problem 1: Probabilities and Statistics
1. a. x discrete, y discrete:
      Position on chessboard
      x in {A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H}
      y in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

   b. x continuous, y discrete
      x: time value
      y: time shown in digital clock (in second)

   c. x continuous, y continuous
      Object position in world coordinate system
      x: x-coordinate
      y: y-coordinate
